# evil-iedit-multiple-cursors

An attempt to implement multiple cursors of the poor that works with Evil.
Won't be as powerful and slick as magnar's multiple cursors but it should allow quite a few use cases.

See this as a not bad fallback in the case where Evil support for multiple cursors is problematic.

Not yet usable, WIP.
